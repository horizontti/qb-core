QBUS-CORE

I have been developing this Core myself for about half a year. 
I bought this Core in the past as defective and out of interest I fixed it. 
More is possible here than with other qbus Core developers. 
You can hire employees on a grade basis. 
This also includes connectqueue, so you don't need it separately. 
Iâ€™ll gradually start publishing more scripts here as I get to develop them as far as possible. 
This is fully functional, no bugs or anything like that ..
